# Design Patterns
In This Repository, I try to learn design patterns in PHP with ChatGPT.
You will find some of the most common used patterns in the field, with a good explanation.

### Engineers refers to a commonly used solution to a recurrent problem in software design.

A pattern describes a general, reusable solution to a typical problem that often occurs in a given context, with the expectation of yielding specific benefits.

### There are different types of software design patterns, including:

1. Creational Patterns - These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms that vary from use cases. They encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.

2. Structural Patterns - These patterns deal with object composition. They combine classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality that would be impossible to accomplish on their own.

3. Behavioral Patterns - These patterns are concerned with algorithms and how objects and classes collaborate with each other to perform a task.

Examples of some popular design patterns include the Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Command Pattern, and many more.

The application of design patterns facilitates a faster, more effective, and efficient software development process. It ensures that the software design is of high quality, easy to maintain, and extensible.
